    <h1 class="projects"> Project #2:  Website Development and AI Bot Integration </h1>
  
    <h2 class="Description">Description</h2>
    <p>Website Development: Leveraging my skills in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, I designed and developed a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing website. <br> 
       The site serves as a platform to share valuable content, insights, and information on various technology-related topics.</p>
<br>
<br>
       <p>AI Bot Integration: <br> <br>
         With the guidance of ChatGPT, I integrated an AI chatbot into the website to enhance user engagement. <br>
         The chatbot, powered by advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology, assists visitors in navigating the site, <br>
         finding relevant content, and answering their questions. No use of Api's on this project just a hard coded prompt AI Bot.</p>
